# Server-based Web Programming Course

## Assignment-two: Portfolio Creation 

##### A [mockup page is here](https://nuux14.github.io/Sample-Portfolio/). You can modify yours but basic design should look     similar

## Project Overview
For this project, you'll be building a portfolio website. You will be provided a design mockup as image files, and you must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete through this course. Please note that while you should aim to recreate the mockup, you may also use your own custom images to personalize this project.



Once you've successfully replicated the design mockup, you are encouraged to continue tweaking and making customizations to the design to personalize it and make it your own! This is your living portfolio site, so make sure you're happy with it.

### Why this project?
The first thing potential employers look for isn’t which school you attended or what your GPA was; they want to see what you’ve built! You need a professional portfolio to show off your skills.

In this project you’ll build a great looking portfolio where you can show off images, descriptions and links to all of your projects. You'll do so by writing code that conforms to the guidelines stated herein.

### What will I learn?
You will learn how HTML is used to define the content of a web page and start to think of every web page as a number of boxes on the screen. You’ll then learn how to position those boxes and make them beautiful using CSS.

### Why is this important to my career?
* Without a portfolio, recruiters won’t even look at your resume much less interview you.
* At their very foundation, web applications are just content delivery mechanisms; HTML defines how that language is structured.
* Reading poorly designed content is never an enjoyable experience; CSS empowers you to create beautiful content regardless of your user’s device.

### Note

The design mockup for this project is located inside this repository.

## Project Details
### How do I Complete this Project?
Consider using Bootstrap components and grid system.

2. Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.
3. Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
4. Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.
5. Validate your HTML and CSS against the [W3C's Validators](http://validator.w3.org/).
